# Technical Indicators

If criteria on technical indicators such as Bollinger bands and RSI have yet to be satisfied, then no orders can be placed. For Bollinger bands, this means if price is inside the Bollinger bands with the specified parameters \(i.e. price has not yet been sufficiently stretched away from the moving average\) For RSI, this means that the indicator needs to be showing oversold before a demand order is placed or overbought before sell order is placed.

The criteria can be made specific to a single time frame or a range of consecutive time frames.

## **Bollinger band std dev:**

The standard deviation for the Bollinger bands. If set to 0, no limitations apply

## **Bollinger band moving average period:**

The moving average period for the Bollinger band

## **Bollinger band minimum time frame:**

The lowest time frame for which the Bollinger band criteria must apply

## **Bollinger band maximum time frame:**

The highest time frame for which the Bollinger band criteria must apply

## **RSI Overbought/overbought band size \(e.g. 30\)**

Represents the size of the band at the top and bottom of the range that is considered to be overbought or oversold respectively. For instance, if set to 30, the currency pair is considered overbought when RSI falls in the range 70-100 and oversold when in the range 0-30.

## **RSI minimum time frame:**

The lowest time frame for which the RSI criteria must apply

## **RSI maximum time frame:**

The highest time frame for which the RSI criteria must apply
