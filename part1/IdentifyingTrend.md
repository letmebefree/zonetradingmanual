# Trend

Trend can be defined in different ways by different traders. It is very hard to find a consistent definition However, when using zones a very specific, consistent and repeatable approach is required.

The principle used by the EA is that imbalances between supply and demand create price movement, which then dictates the direction of the trend. This raises the question of whether trend is necessary to determine future price movement, or if trend is simply the consequence of supply and demand across multiple time frames producing a net movement on price?

For purposes of trading supply and demand, the definition of trend is kept simple. When price last touched or created a supply zone, then the trend is down. Conversely, when price last touched or created a demand zone, then the trend must be up.

This approach is based on the idea that supply creates a downward pressure on price, whilst demand creates an upward pressure on price. When price has just left an area of supply, it must be moving lower and will continue to do so until the effects of demand start reducing the imbalance of buy and sell orders. Likewise, when price  has just touched demand, price movement or trend will change to up and will continue to be so until the imbalance of buy and sell order reverses once again. This continual changing of direction of trend is what causes price to move in waves as it progresses in the direction of a higher time frame trend.

The EA does not particularly consider such a thing as a sideways move, preferring to consider it as a series of alternate up and down trends, where price is trapped between supply and demand zones on the higher time frame.

Of course, price movement is not just based on supply on supply and demand from a single time frame, but the resulting net effect from zones across multiple time frame. This is why it becomes so important to understand what is happening across all time frames, in particular those longer term ones. One of the key benefits of Zone-Trader tutor is that it helps you do this much more quickly and effectively.
