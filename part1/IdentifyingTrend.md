# Two Types of Trend
Trend is typically defined in many different ways by many different types of traders. However, when using zones a different approach is required than normal. The principle we work on is that supply and demand always creates the trend, which then dictates the direction of price movement. This means we cannot use trend to determine price movement as only one can be the cause of the other without creating a circular reference.

Our definition of trend is simple. If price last touched or created a supply zone, then the trend is down. If price last touched or created a demand zone, then the trend is up. This approach enforces the idea that zones of supply and demand always reverse price. Therefore after a zone has recently been created or retouched, price will start to move  away from it until it touches an opposing zone to send it the other way.

Of course, this does not mean that the new trend will last very long. The distance between zones is an important measure to analyse to understand how far price will move in one direction before it reverses in the opposite direction. Overlaying all these zones on top of each other dictates the longer term direction of price movement.
