# Two Types of Trend
Trend is typically defined in many different ways by many different types of traders. However, when using zones a different approach is required than normal. The principle we work on is that supply and demand always creates the trend, which then dictates the direction of price movement. This means we cannot use trend to determine price movement as only one can be the cause of the other without creating a circular reference.
