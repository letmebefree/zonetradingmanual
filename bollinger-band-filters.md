# Bollinger Band Filters

Only zones touching Bollinger Bands:

This filter checks whether any candle between the start and end of the zone is touching, breaking or outside of the upper or lower Bollinger band. In the case of a demand zone, it must be the lower Bollinger Band, whilst for a supply zone it must be the upper Bollinger band. The standard deviation and moving average for the Bollinger Band default to 2.0 and 20 respectively, but may  changed as required.
