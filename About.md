# About Zone-Trader

Zone-Trader is an expert adviser written for the MT4 or MT5 trading platforms. Its fundamental approach is to identify zones of potential supply and demand across different time frames and represent these in a way that allows traders to quickly identify when to buy, when to sell and when to stay out of the market. The zones can then be filtered based on a large number of criteria such that only those considered high probability opportunities are displayed. For instance, it is possible to display only trades that are in line with the current trend on the same time frame. This is a simple example, but much more advanced parameters, or combinations of parameters may be used.

Of course, understanding how each of these parameters impact the overall probability of a trading opportunity achieving its goal is key to this approach. This is why the Expert Adviser  provides a back testing capability that enables detailed analysis of supply and demand across different time frames and currencies with filtering criteria being applied in many different ways.

When an apparently successful configuration of parameters (strategy) has been designed for the given market conditions, the next step is to trade the strategy consistently. Of course, no one wants to sit in front of a screen for hours on end waiting for the exact set of conditions as back tested to occur. Murphy's law dictates that it will just at that time you are sleeping, or when you are away for a day that those conditions occur. This is why the expert adviser also provides an auto-trading capability. Using this, its a simple case of flipping a switch to tell it to start trading the strategy that you have just back tested. This is when you can leave it running whilst you enjoy the rest of your life and removing the temptation to interfere with trades and corrupt the strategy.
