### **TARGETS**

## **Minimum target Rs required:**

The value of 1R is always considered as the distance between the order entry and the stop loss. Once an initial target price for a zone has been calculated and set according to the previous setting, it will equate to a given multiple of Rs. In instances where this number of Rs is less than the parameter value, the zone will be considered invalid and no orders or trades will be placed on a retest.

The purpose of this parameter is to ensure that there is sufficient profit margin available relative to the risk associated with the trade.

## **Minimum target pips required:**

The distance between the order entry and the targe can be specified as a number of pips. Once an initial target price for a zone has been calculated and set according to the previous setting, it will equate to a given multiple of Pips. In instances where this number of Pips is less than the parameter value, the zone will be considered invalid and no orders or trades will be placed on a retest.

The purpose of this parameter is to ensure that there is sufficient profit margin available relative to the risk associated with the trade.
