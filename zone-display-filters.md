# ZONE FILTERS

The parameters described in the following pages are used to filter the zones displayed on the chart. By default, active \(unfiltered\) zones will be drawn using thick lines, whilst inactive \(filtered out\) zones will be drawn with thin lines. 

If it is preferred for inactive zones to be removed completely to give a cleaner looking chart, this can achieved by setting the display parameters "Invalid zone line width to WIDTH\_0. Similarly, the line width for active zones can also be adjusted.
