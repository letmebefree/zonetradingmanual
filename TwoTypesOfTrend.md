# Two Types of Trend
The Zone-Trader expert adviser defines and refers to two types of trend. These are the "TDL" trend and the "standard" trend (or just "the trend"). 

The TDL trend refers to the immediate direction of price seen on a candle chart. For example, if there are successive bull candles, each with a higher close, then the TDL trend is considered up. 

The standard trend refers to the longer term movement of price, ignoring short term retracements that occur as price moves  in its wave like motion.

Both types of trend are determined at the close of the last completed candle and are always stated in reference to a specific time frame. For example, the TDL trend on a one hour chart may be up, whilst at the same time, the TDL trend on the daily chart may be down.

The image below highlights the differences between the two types of trend.

Typically, the standard trend on one time frame will be the same as the TDL trend on the next higher time frame. Below we can see the same chart as above, but on a higher time frame.

The expert adviser uses very well defined rules to calculate the direction of both TDL and standard trends. It is the use of these rules that enables a systematic and consistent trading strategy to be implemented.
