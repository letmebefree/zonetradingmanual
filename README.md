Zone trader tutor is a Metatrader 4 expert adviser developed to identify supply and demand zones on a chart, then filtering thise based on on zone attributes, technical indicators or price action. Filters can be combined with further entry and exit criteria to develop strategies that the EA will auto-trade on your behalf. It can be your own personal forex trading tutor, guiding you through the complexities of trading the markets, demonstrating how to identify and then trade new strategies based on institutional orders.

My name is Graeme. I defined the zone trading concept used by the expert adviser and have spent many years developing its functionality, introducing many new features over this time. The Expert Adviser now includes strategies for stop management, target setting and position sizing, as well as continuous addition of new innovative parameters for determining the strength of supply and demand at any given zone.

If you are interested in this way of trading and using the expert adviser, more information and access to the zone trader tutor can be found at [forum.letmebefree.com](www.letmebefree.com)
