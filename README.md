# Zone Trading For Consistent Profitability

Supply and demand are the fundamental drivers of price movement for any product or service. When supply exceeds demand, sellers must reduce prices to entice the limited buyers available. If demand exceeds supply, buyers may have to pay more to persuade limited sellers to transact with them.

If zones of supply and demand are identified using price charts, price movements can be predicted with high probability. This ability enables consistently profitable trading in the financial markets.

Zone trading is an approach where a tool helps us view layers of supply and demand for different time frames on a single chart. This provides an innate ability to predict the level price is going to next and what might happen when price gets there.
