# Summary

Supply and demand trading is an approach used by many successful traders to identify high probability trading opportunities, through identification of zones where large institutions are going to be placing their orders.

The accumulation of such orders in these zones create a a significant shift in the balance of buy and sell orders, commonly causing price to significantly retrace or reverse to resume a longer term trend seen on a higher time frame .

Through identification of such levels on a chart and quantifying the degree of imbalance present, we can place our own limit orders just in front of where large institutions are doing exactly the same thing. This allows us to swim in the same direction as the institutions, massively increasing our odds of consistent profitability.
