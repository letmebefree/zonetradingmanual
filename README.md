# Summary

Supply and demand trading is an approach used by many successful traders to identify high probability trading opportunities, through identification of zones where large institutions are going to be placing their orders.

The accumulation of such orders in these zones create a a significant shift in the balance of buy and sell orders, commonly causing price to significantly retrace or reverse to resume a longer term trend seen on a higher time frame .

Through identification of such levels on a chart and quantifying the degree of imbalance present, we can place our own limit orders just in front of where large institutions are doing exactly the same thing. This allows us to swim in the same direction as the institutions, massively increasing our odds of consistent profitability.

Zone-Trader tutor is a Meta-trader 4 expert adviser designed specifically to identify, filter and then display supply and demand zones across different time frames on a chart in a way that they can be effectively used in our trading. It allows traders to develop alternative strategies around these that can then be left to auto-trade.

Selected zone criteria can be combined with further entry and exit requirements to develop strategies that the EA can auto-trade on your behalf whilst you sleep. The strategies allow you to determine entry levels, stop loss placement, target setting and alternative exit strategies \(trailing stops\), whilst also taking care of position sizing risk management.

Through doing this, the expert adviser can become your own personal Forex trading tutor, guiding you through the complexities of trading the markets, demonstrating how to identify and then trade new strategies based on institutional orders.
