Zone trader tutor is a Metatrader 4 expert adviser used to identify supply and demand zones,  create strategies based on zone parameters, technical indicators or price action, test strategies by back testing them and then auto-trade the strategies you have created. It can be your own personal forex trading tutor, guiding you through the complexities of trading the markets, demonstrating how to identify and then trade new strategies based on institutional orders.

My name is Graeme Dakers. I defined the zone trading concept used by the expert adviser and have spent many years developing its functionality, introducing many new features over this time. The Expert Adviser now includes strategies for stop management, target setting and position sizing, as well as continuous addition of new innovative parameters for determining the strength of supply and demand at any given zone.
