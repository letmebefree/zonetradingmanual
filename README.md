Zone trader is a Metatrader 4 expert adviser for identifying supply and demand zones, creating and backtesting strategies with different zone filtering and then trading the strategies you have created.

My name is Graeme Dakers. I defined the zone trading concept used by the expert adviser and have spent many years developing its functionality, introducing many new amazing features over this time. For example, there are now alternative strategies for stop management, target setting and position sizing, as well as continuous addition of new innovative parameters for determining the strength of supply and demand at any zone.
