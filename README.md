Zone trader is a Metatrader 4 expert adviser used to identify supply and demand zones,  back-testing strategies with different zone filters and then trading the strategies you have created.

My name is Graeme Dakers. I defined the zone trading concept used by the expert adviser and have spent many years developing its functionality, introducing many new amazing features over this time. It now includes strategies for stop management, target setting and position sizing, as well as continuous addition of new innovative parameters for determining the strength of supply and demand at any given zone.
