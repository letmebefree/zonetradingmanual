# An Introduction To Supply And Demand

Supply and demand are the drivers behind all price movement for any stock, currency or commodity. To understand how they work, we need to remember that there must always be a buyer and a seller for every completed transaction. The buyer has a maximum price they will pay the seller, whilst the seller has a minimum price at which they will sell to the buyer. When we consider that the market is made up of a large number of buyers and sellers, all of which have their own view of how much something is worth, there is nearly always going to be an imbalance of buyers and sellers at any given price point. This imbalance is what causes price to fluctuate between price levels.

The availability of buyers or sellers to enter into transactions at a price level is  represented in the market by the volume of buy and sell limit orders at the levels. Buy limit orders indicate that there is demand at a specific price below current price. Sell limit orders indicate that that there is supply at a specific price above current price. The strength of supply and demand is represented by the volume or orders.

Buy and sell limit orders create liquidity in the market. However, their presence does not directly impact the current price. This only occurs when a limit order is filled by a market order. 

A market order is used by a new entrant who wants to buy or sell at the best price available. The best price depends on the closest level where there are limit orders present (hence why limit orders provide liquidity). 

As a result of the limit order being filled, a new current price is determined. The current price as seen on a chart always represents the last transacted price, not the available price to trade at.

As new buyers continue to enter the market, the price at which they can transact will move higher as the nearby sell limit orders get absorbed. This  stops once there are no  buyers remaining who are prepared to trade at the higher prices. 

The higher price goes, the lower the number of buyers that remain in the market. Conversely, as price increases, more sellers will be prepared to enter transactions with those buyers. At some point, the number of sellers will exceed the number of buyer and price will continue to fall again. This explains why price generally follows a trend using a wave like motion.

Typically, limit orders accumulate at certain price levels where the party placing the order can easily quantify their risk. This is best done at previous turning points in price, with a stop placed beyond the most extreme price achieved before price turned. The assumption is that if price could not exceed a specific supply level, then at that point in time there must have been other sellers who were also looking to sell but did not get a chance before price reversed. The converse situatin occurs at a demand level.
