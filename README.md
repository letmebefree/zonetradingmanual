# Zone Trading For Consistent Profitability

Supply and demand are the fundamental drivers of price movement for any product or service. When supply exceeds demand, sellers must reduce prices to entice the limited buyers available. If demand exceeds supply, buyers may have to pay more to persuade limited sellers to take the other side of their trade.

With the right knowledge, supply and demand zones are identifiable on price charts. Price movements between these zones are then predicable with high probability. This capability enables consistently profitable trading in the financial markets.

Zone trading uses a tool to help us view zones of supply and demand from different time frames on a single price chart.
