# Zone Trading For Consistent Profitability

Supply and demand are the fundamental drivers of price movement for any stock or commodity. When supply exceeds demand, sellers must reduce prices to entice the limited buyers available. If demand exceeds supply, buyers may have to pay more to persuade limited sellers to take the other side of their trade.

If we can identify price levels where there is excess supply or demand, this allows us to enter trades knowing with some certainty that price will move in our favor as soon as that level is hit. The challenge is then to know how far it is going to move.

A key point to remember is that there is always two parties involved in a single trade, namely the buyer and a seller. If either party is missing, then the transaction cannot occur. You may ask why there are always traders wanting to sell when price is in a strong up-trend on the chart you are looking at. The answer is clear when we consider that different traders are looking at different time frames. So whilst price may be increasing on the daily time frame, it could easily be in a down trend on either the smaller hourly time frame, or on the higher weekly time frame. There are many different participants in the market, each one with different objectives and priorities and this is what makes a liquid market.

With the right knowledge, supply and demand zones are identifiable on price charts. Price movements between these zones are then predicable with high probability. This capability enables consistently profitable trading in the financial markets.

Zone trading uses a tool to help us view zones of supply and demand from different time frames on a single price chart.
