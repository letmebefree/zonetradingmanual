# Summary

Supply and demand trading is an approach used by many successful traders to identify high probability trading opportunities, based on a strategy that seeks to identify where large institutions are  placing their own orders.

The accumulation of such orders often creates a a significant shift in the balance of buy and sell orders, commonly causing price to significantly retrace or reverse to resume a longer term trend seen on a higher time frame . 

Through identification of such levels on a chart, we can place our own limit orders just in front of where large institutions are doing exactly the same thing. By doing the same as large institutions, we are swimming with the tide and massively increasing our odds of consistent profitability.

Zone-Trader tutor is a Meta-trader 4 expert adviser designed specifically to identify, filter and then display supply and demand zones across different time frames on a chart in a way that they can be effectively used in our trading. It allows traders to develop alternative strategies around these that can then be left to auto-trade.

Selected zone criteria can be combined with further entry and exit requirements to develop strategies that the EA can auto-trade on your behalf whilst you sleep. The strategies allow you to determine entry levels, stop loss placement, target setting and alternative exit strategies \(trailing stops\), whilst also taking care of position sizing risk management.

Through doing this, the expert adviser can become your own personal Forex trading tutor, guiding you through the complexities of trading the markets, demonstrating how to identify and then trade new strategies based on institutional orders.
