# An Introduction To Supply And Demand

Supply and demand are the fundamental drivers behind price movement of any stock or commodity. To understand how it works, we must be remembered that there is always two parties involved in a single trade - the buyer and a seller.

Sellers create supply by indicating the lowest price at which they are prepared to enter a short trade (the ask price). 

Buyers create demand by indicating the highest price at which they are prepared to enter a long trade (the bid price). 

The bid and ask price are levels where the respective parties believe they are getting good value.Their willingness to enter a transaction at set levels is generally represented in the market with buy and sell limit orders. A buy limit order indicates that a party will transact at a price below current price. A sell limit order indicates that a party will transact at a price above current price. Buy and sell limit orders represent liquidity in the market and their volume at different price levels is what drives available supply and demand.

Buy and sell limit orders cannot change prices by themselves. For this to happen, a transaction needs to  occur at a price between the two levels. This requires one of two conditions to be met. Either a compromise in price must be agreed by the buyer or seller. Or a new entrant must appear who is prepared to transact at the price represented by the limit orders. Market orders are used to indicates the party will buy or sell at the best price available. The new price is determined by the closest limit order available to meet that party's needs.

Put simply, when supply exceeds demand, sellers must reduce prices to entice the limited buyers available. Conversely, if demand exceeds supply, buyers have to pay more to persuade limited sellers to take the other side of their trade.

By identifying price levels where there is excess supply or demand, a pending order can be entered at that level, knowing that price is almost guaranteed to move in our favor as soon as the order is triggered. The remaining challenge is to determine how far into profit the trade will go and the path it will take to get there.

 You may ask why there are always traders wanting to sell when price is in a strong up-trend on the chart you are looking at. The answer is clear when we consider that different traders are looking at different time frames. So whilst price may be increasing on the daily time frame, it could easily be in a down trend on either the smaller hourly time frame, or on the higher weekly time frame. There are many different participants in the market, each one with different objectives and priorities and this is what makes a liquid market.

With the right knowledge, supply and demand zones are identifiable on price charts. Price movements between these zones are then predicable with high probability. This capability enables consistently profitable trading in the financial markets.
