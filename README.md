# An Introduction To Supply And Demand

Supply and demand are the fundamental drivers behind the movement in price of any stock, currency or commodity. To understand how price movement works, we need to remember that there is always a buyer and a seller involved in every transaction. The buyer has a maximum price they will pay, whilst the seller has a minimum price at which they will sell to the buyer. When we consider that the market is made up of a large number of buyers and sellers, all of which have their own view of how much something is worth, there is nearly always going to be an imbalance of buyers and sellers at any given price point. It is this imbalance of supply and demand that causes price to move.

The willingness of buyers or sellers to enter into transactions at specific price levels is  represented in the market with buy and sell limit orders. A buy limit order indicates that a party will transact at a price below current price. A sell limit order indicates that a party will transact at a price above current price. Buy and sell limit orders represent liquidity in the market and their volume at different price levels is what drives the available supply and demand. However, the presence of buy and sell limit orders alone does not directly impact the current price. For the price to change a completed transaction is required. 

This is achieved by a market order, which is used when a new entrant will buy or sell at the best price available. The new price is determined by the closest limit order available to meet that party's needs.

If new buyers who wish to enter at the lowest price available continue to exist, the price at which they can transact will move higher and higher as sell limit orders get absorbed. This will only stop once there are no longer any buyers left who are prepared to trade at the higher prices. The higher price goes, the lower the number of buyers that remain in the market. Conversely, as price increases, more sellers will be prepared to enter transactions with those buyers. At some point, the number of sellers will exceed the number of buyer and price will continue to fall again

Typically, limit orders accumulate at certain price levels where the party placing the order can easily quantify their risk.

Put simply, when supply exceeds demand, sellers must reduce prices to entice the limited buyers available. Conversely, if demand exceeds supply, buyers have to pay more to persuade limited sellers to take the other side of their trade.

By identifying price levels where there is excess supply or demand, a pending order can be entered at that level, knowing that price is almost guaranteed to move in our favor as soon as the order is triggered. The remaining challenge is to determine how far into profit the trade will go and the path it will take to get there.

 You may ask why there are always traders wanting to sell when price is in a strong up-trend on the chart you are looking at. The answer is clear when we consider that different traders are looking at different time frames. So whilst price may be increasing on the daily time frame, it could easily be in a down trend on either the smaller hourly time frame, or on the higher weekly time frame. There are many different participants in the market, each one with different objectives and priorities and this is what makes a liquid market.

With the right knowledge, supply and demand zones are identifiable on price charts. Price movements between these zones are then predicable with high probability. This capability enables consistently profitable trading in the financial markets.
