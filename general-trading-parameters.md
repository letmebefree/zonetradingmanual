# General Trading Parameters

### Trading Time Frame

**Timeframe for placing trades:**

Only zones from the selected time frame will be used for creating new limit orders during auto-testing. If you wish to trade the same strategy for zones on multiple time frames, then multiple instances of the Expert Adviser must be set up on separate charts based on the same symbol.

### Trade Entry Buffer Values

**Entry Buffer in pips**

The value in this parameter will move the order entry closer to price to give a higher probability of the order being triggered.

**Stop buffer in pips**

The value in this parameter will move the order stop loss further from price such that the order is not stopped out if price passes though it by just a few pips.
