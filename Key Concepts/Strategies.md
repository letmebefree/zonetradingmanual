# Strategies

For the purposes of the EA, a strategy is defined as a set of parameters with given values.

Different sets of parameters with different values will create a completely different strategy. One of the key features of this EA is that it enables you to set up different strategies based on factors such as current market conditions, the time frame you want to trade, or how long you want to stay in a trade.

For example, it is just as easy to set up a short-term scalping strategy that takes trades on the M15 chart as it is to set up a long-term strategy that takes trades on the H4 chart and targets zones on a weekly chart.

Another example is, if trading an existing strong trend, you may wish to only trade retests that happen within a short time of the zone forming.
