# Two Types of Trend
When using the Zone-Trader expert adviser, two types of trend are commonly referred to. These are known as the "TDL trend" and the "standard trend" (also know as "the trend"). Both types are always stated in refernces to a specific time frame. For example, the TDL trend on a one hour chart may be up whilst the TDL trend on the daily chart is down.

The TDL trend always refers to the more immediate direction of price as seen on a chart. The standard trend refers to the longer term movement of price, allowing for retracements that occur for the duration of that trend.

For a rule based strategy to apply, there must be clear criteria for determining the direction of the current trend (TDL and standard versions) as well as when retracement or consolidation is occuring. The expert adviser will always calculate the standard or TDL trend as either up or down.
