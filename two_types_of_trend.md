# Two Types of Trend
When using the Zone-Trader expert adviser, two types of trend are commonly referred to. These are known as the "TDL trend" and the "standard trend" (also know as "the trend"). Both types are always stated in refernces to a specific time frame. For example, the TDL trend on a one hour chart may be up whilst the TDL trend on the daily chart is down.

The TDL trend always refers to the more immediate direction of price as seen on a chart. It will always be either up or down. The standard trend will also be up or down and refers to the longer term movement of price, allowing for retracements that occur for the duration of that trend. The image below highlights the differences between the TDL trend and the standard trend

For a rule based strategy to apply, the expert adviser will always calculate the standard or TDL trend as either up or down. There is no such thing as a consolidating or retracing trend, even though it may seem that price has been range bound.
