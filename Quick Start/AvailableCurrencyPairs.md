# Currency Pairs

For chart analysis, the EA is able to display zones across any currency pair or index. This includes precious metals such as Gold and Silver, as well as the well known stock market indices.

However, when using auto-trading, there is no position sizing mechanism built into the EA for symbols that contain anything other than the following: EUR, GBP, AUD, NZD, JPY, CAD and USD.

If you wish to trade anything other than the currencies listed above, you will need to manually set a fixed position size. The EA will not be able to calculate this for you and unpredictable results may occur.

> It is essential that you test trading of any commodity other than the currencies listed above using a demo account and only use a fixed position size
