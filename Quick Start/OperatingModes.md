# Operating Modes

## **EA Mode of Operation:**

There are three selectable modes of operation for Zone-Trader Tutor available. These includes:

* EA\_MODE\_FREE\_ANALYSIS 
* EA\_MODE\_LIVE\_ANALYSIS 
* EA\_MODE\_AUTO\_TRADING.

Each of the modes are summarised below:

**EA\_MODE\_FREE\_ANALYSIS**

This is the default mode when the EA is first loaded and only operated on the daily, weekly and monthly time frames.  It is used to view zones on the chart without any trading or placing of order occuring. Whilst operating the EA in this mode, it is possible to filter the zones that appear using any parameters that appear in the "Chart Analysis" parameter section of this document. Values being filtered by the parameters under these sections are typically those that only change when a new candle opens or a zone is stopped out. It does not include any parameters filtering values that change every tick \(e.g. values of technical indicators, time of day\).

**EA\_MODE\_LIVE\_ANALYSIS**

This mode is used to view zones on the chart without any trading or placing of order occuring. Whilst operating the EA in this mode, it is possible to filter the zones that appear using any parameters that appear in the"Chart Analysis" parameter section of this document. Values being filtered by the parameters under these sections are those that only change when a new candle opens or when a zone is stopped out.

This mode must be selected when you want the EA to place a pending \(or market\) order when all criteria for the strategy settings are met.
