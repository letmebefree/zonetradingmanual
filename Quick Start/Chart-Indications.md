# Chart Indications

You will see a number of indicators and labels and charts that it is important to understand.

## Summary Information

In the top left of the chart, you can see the following:

An indication of the current trend for each time frame for which zones are currently being identified.

In the chart below, we see the text ”MN1:U W1:U D1:D H1:D M30:D M15:D”.

Amongst other things, this tells us that the current trend on the W1 chart is up, whilst the trend on the M30 chart is down.

Underneath the trend indicators,, you will see indicators representing the move up and move down for both the current week and the current day. The calculation is performed as follows:

The **daily **moves for the latest candle are calculated every tick, based on whether the closing price of the candle was above \(bullish\) or below \(bearish\) the open price.

For a bullish candle:

* Daily move up = High – Low
* Daily move down = Maximum of: High – Close, Open - Low

For a bearish candle:

* Daily move up = Maximum of: Close – Low, High – Open
* Daily move down = High - Low

The weekly moves for each candle are calculated based on whether the closing price of the candle was above \(bullish\) or below \(bearish\) the open price.

For a bullish candle:

* Weekly up move = High – Low

* Weekly down move = Maximum of: High – Close, Open - Low

For a bearish candle:

* Weekly up move = Maximum of: Close – Low, High – Open
* Weekly down move = High - Low

## Zone Markings

At the start or each line, you will notice a D or S followed by a number. The number represents the previous retests of the zone, whilst the D/S indicate if the zone is supply or demand.
