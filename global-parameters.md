The following parameters are compulsory and enable authentication of the EA and unique identification of the EA instance on a specific chart.

**Username:**

This must be the user name provided when first subscribing to use the Expert Adviser. It will be a unique name for every person who is using the expert advisor. Typcially, this should be the user name that you have used to register for the forum \(if applicable\).

**EA License key:**

A license key will be provided when you first subscribe to using the Expert Adviser. This acts as a password that when entered as a parameter with the correct forum username, authenticating you against the central licensing database as a valid and paid up subscriber. The EA license key is unique to you and must not be shared with any other person.

**Unique EA Identifier:**

This is a numeric value that uniquely identifies the instance of an Expert Adviser running on a given chart. An EA with the given identifier can only delete or modify orders and trades that are created either by the same EA, or by another instance of an EA that is using the same identifier. This allows a global strategy that crosses EA's running on two or more multiple currency pair charts to be used. Each EA could even have different strategy parameter settings.

An important use of this would be the management of risk when running multiple instances of the EA across many different currency pairs.
