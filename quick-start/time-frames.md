# Time Frames

The time frames available on the Metatrader 4, from smallest to highest are as follows:

M1-&gt;M5-&gt;M15-&gt;M30-&gt;H1-&gt;H4-&gt;D1-&gt;W1-&gt;MN1

The free version of the EA will only use D1, W1 and MN1

When this document or the EA refers to the “next” highest time frame, this means the time frame immediately to the right of the said time frame in the list above. Similarly, to find the next lower time frame, this means the time frame immediately to the left in the list above.
