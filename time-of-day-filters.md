# Time of Day Filters

Time of day filters place time limits on what time of day orders can be placed.

The start and end hours for trading can be set up for three different time periods \(typically relating to Tokyo, London and New York sessions\). Only if the current server time falls within any one of these ranges will placement of new orders be allowed. 

The values entered represent the hour for the candles on the chart as per the broker server time. Therefore, the values to be entered need to be derived from the local times for each session \(e.g. 8am to 5pm\).
