# Supply And Demand

Supply and demand are the drivers behind all price movement for any stock, currency or commodity. To understand how they work, we need to remember that there must always be a buyer and a seller for every completed transaction. The buyer has a maximum price they will pay the seller, whilst the seller has a minimum price at which they will sell to the buyer. When we consider that the market is made up of a large number of buyers and sellers, all of which have their own view of how much something is worth, there is nearly always going to be an imbalance of buyers and sellers at any given price point. This imbalance is what causes price to fluctuate between price levels.

The willingness of buyers or sellers to enter into transactions at a specific price level is  represented in the market by the volume of buy or sell limit orders at that level. Buy limit orders indicate that there is demand at a specific price below current price. Sell limit orders indicate that that there is supply at a specific price above current price. The strength of supply and demand is represented by the volume of sell and buy limit orders respectively.

Whilst buy and sell limit orders create liquidity in the market, their presence does not directly impact the current price. This only occurs when a limit order is actually filled, typically by a market order. 

A market order is used by a participant who wants to trade at the best price available at that point in time. The best price depends on where limit orders are present in relation to the price showed at the time of entry (hence why limit orders provide liquidity). If the best price is some distance from the the currently displayed price, then slippage may occur. In particular, large slippage can occur if there is a lot of competition to fill only a few availablelimit orders.  

Once a limit order is filled, a new current price is set. This means the current price on a chart represents the last transacted price, not the current bid or offer. If a long bodied candle is seen on a standard candle chart, this means that price has moved a long distance in relatively little time. Therefore, it is unlikely that much trading could have occurred at prices contained within the candle body. 

When new buyers continue to enter the market, the price at which they are able to trade will move higher as the closest sell limit orders are absorbed. Eventually, the number of buyers prepared to trade at the higher prices diminishes and price starts moving up slower. The higher price goes, the lower the number of buyers that remain in the market and the less price will be able to move up. At the same time, as price increases, more sellers will be prepared to enter into transactions with those remaining buyers. 

At some point, the number of sellers will exceed the number of buyer and price will continue to fall again and the process starts over again. This explains why price generally follows a trend using a wave like motion.

Typically, limit orders accumulate at certain price levels where the party placing the order can easily quantify their risk. This is best done at previous turning points in price, with a stop placed beyond the most extreme price achieved before price turned. The assumption is that if price could not exceed a specific supply level, then at that point in time there must have been other sellers who were also looking to sell but did not get a chance before price reversed. The converse situation occurs at a demand level.
